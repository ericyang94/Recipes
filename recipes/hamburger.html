    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>The Krabby Patty is a thing of pop culture culinary legend - a burger, forged from a secret formula, worshipped by a sociopathically upbeat sponge. How do we go about recreating that which is not reacreate-able? A bit of science, a bit of whimsy, and a whole lot of wanton conjecture. Fill in the blanks with me this week as we build an umami burger using ingredients from mother ocean!</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound chuck steak</li>
        <li>1 pound bone-in short ribs</li>
        <li>Salt & pepper to taste</li>
        <li>2 tsp MSG</li>
        <li>2 Tbsp vegetable oil</li>
        <li>2 ounces shredded iceberg lettuce</li>
        <li>1 slice yellow American cheese</li>
        <li>1 small vidalia onion, sliced thinly</li>
        <li>1 beefsteak tomato, sliced thinly</li>
        <li>Ketchup to taste</li>
        <li>Mustard to taste</li>
        <li>1 large dill pickle, sliced thinly</li>
        <li>4 sesame seed hamburger buns</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Trim and cut beef into 1-inch pieces, and spread evenly on a parchment-lined baking sheet. Place in the freezer for 15 minutes, along with the blade of a food processor, until beef is firm. Pulse in the food processor until beef is ground and pebbly. Shape into 4 patties, and season with salt, pepper, and MSG.</li>
        <li>Heat vegetable oil in a large cast iron skillet over medium-high heat until barely smoking.  Add patties and reduce heat to medium - cook to desired doneness.</li>
        <li>On the burger buns, assemble the burgers in this order: patty, lettuce, cheese, onion, tomato, ketchup, mustard, pickles, top bun.</li>
    </ol>
